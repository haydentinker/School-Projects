# CPTR 108: Student Assignments Repository

Welcome to the Walla Walla University The Art and Practice of Computer Science git repository for student assignments.
This repository is designed to be used with the [Code.CS](http://code.cs.wallawalla.edu/) online development environment. 


## Contents

This repository can be used for all your python code over the quarter.
The project has been posted and you can start working on it now.
Please pay attention to the schedule due dates in the syllabus.
In order to ensure you have the most recent assignments, be sure to *pull* an updated version every time you log in (see below).


## Getting Updated Project Details

While I don't expect to make updates, the pull process will allow you get any changes to the project.
To do this, right click on the `pull.sh` file in your student108 folder and select *Run Code* from the menu.
This can also be done in a terminal using the following commands.

```{bash}
cd ~/code/student108
./pull.sh
```

## Uploading Your Work

As you make changes to your code, be sure to save it frequently using *Ctrl-S* or the File -> Save menu option.
When you have finished a work session, or when you are ready to submit your work for grading, you will need to upload it to the WWU code repository.
To do this, right click on the `push.sh` file in your workspace and select *Run Code* from the menu.
This can also be done in a terminal using the following commands:

```{bash}
cd ~/code/student108
./push.sh
```
