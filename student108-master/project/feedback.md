# Notes
- Junk input not handled by initial selection of rows and columns
- I could enter negative numbers for rows and columns
- The numbering of the display is a range starting from 1, however, when buying a ticket
you're not accounting for this. For example, if I enter row 1 col 1, the seat at row 2 col 2 is sold.
- Would have liked to been able to enter a range of seats to sell
- Junk input not handled when selecting row and column to sell
- I should be able to enter the price I want for each row. Price should not be based
on an average that you found on Google.
