# Homework 5 - Neural Networks

Demonstrate your knowledge __Artificial Neural Networks__ and the five machine learning steps using this algorithm.

For this homework use the __Ionosphere__ dataset provided by UCIâ€™s ML Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere).
Please read over the data source to find more details about the data.
Using __Artificial Neural Networks__, how accurately can you classify if the radar is good or bad?
Does the data need to be transformed for this algorithm, or is the current form ok.

## Requirements

* Use __Artificial Neural Networks__ algorithm.
* Use __Ionosphere__ dataset accessed from UCI's website.
* Describe the accuracy of the model.
* When improving performance, use the algorithms specific options for improving the model.
    Remember you must show at least two options considered when improving the performance.
* Use the following R commands/features
    * __cor__ - use when evaluating the resulting neural net
    * __summary__ - use when exploring the data
    * __plot__ - use to show the neural net
* Include any additional R commands that help describe or detail the data and analysis.

## Rubric

Sections of the report (5 points for each section):

* Algorithm Description
* Step 1 - Collect Data
* Step 2 - Exploring And Preparing The Data
* Step 3 - Training A Model On The Data
* Step 4 - Evaluating Model Performance
* Step 5 - Improving Model Performance

Additional points may be deducted if not all requirements are meet.

__Total:__ 30 points
