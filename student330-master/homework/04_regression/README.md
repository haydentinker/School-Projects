# Homework 4 - Regression Models

Demonstrate your knowledge __Regression Models__ and the five machine learning steps using this algorithm.

For this homework use the __Online News Popularity__ dataset provided by UCI’s ML Repository
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity).
Please read over the data source to find more details about the data.
Using a __Regression Model__, how accurately can you predict the number of shares?

## Requirements

* Use __Linear Regression Model__ algorithm.
* Use __Online News Popularity__ dataset accessed from UCI's website.
* Describe the accuracy of the model.
* When improving performance, use the algorithms specific options for improving the model. Must describe and demonstrate two different methods (even if they don’t improve the model).

* Use the following R commands/features: __cor__, __pairs__ and __wordcloud__
* Include any additional R commands that help describe or detail the data and analysis.

## Rubric

Sections of the report (5 points for each section):

* Algorithm Description
* Step 1 - Collect Data
* Step 2 - Exploring And Preparing The Data
* Step 3 - Training A Model On The Data
* Step 4 - Evaluating Model Performance
