# Homework 1 - Nearest Neighbors

Demonstrate your knowledge k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and the five machine learning steps using this algorithm.
Machine Learning with R detailed k-NN in chapter 3.

For this homework use the Iris dataset provided by UCIâ€™s ML Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).
The dataset has several Iris features, including a class.
Each Iris is classified into one of three classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica.
Using k-Nearest Neighbors, how accurately can you classify an Iris?

An example R Notebook has been posted for the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm homework.
Please follow this example to create your homework submission.

## Requirements

* Use __k-Nearest Neighbors__ (k-NN) algorithm.
* Use __Iris__ dataset.
* Use two different ways to scale the data. Example z-score standardization.
* Use the following R commands/features: __prop.table()__, __plot__, and a __CrossTable__.
* Include any additional R commands that help describe or detail the data and analysis.

## Rubric

Sections of the report (5 points for each section):

* Algorithm description with strengths and weaknesses

* Step 1 - Collect Data
* Step 2 - Exploring And Preparing The Data
* Step 3 - Training A Model On The Data
* Step 4 - Evaluating Model Performance
