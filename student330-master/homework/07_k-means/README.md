# Homework 7 - K-means

Demonstrate your knowledge __k-means__ and the five machine learning steps using this algorithm.

For this homework use the __Tarvel Review Rating__ dataset provided by UCIâ€™s ML Repository
(<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tarvel+Review+Ratings>).
Please read over the data source to find more details about the data.
Using __k-means__, cluster the data and fine appropriate groupings.
Does the data need to be transformed for this algorithm, or is the current form ok?

## Requirements

* Use __k-means__ algorithm.
* Use __Tarvel Review Rating__ dataset accessed from UCI's website.
* Describe the accuracy of the model.
* When improving performance, use the algorithms specific options for improving the model.
  Remember you must show at least __two__ options considered when improving the performance.
* Use the __aggregate__ R command.
* Include any additional R commands that help describe or detail the data and analysis.
