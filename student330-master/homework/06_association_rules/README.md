# Homework 6 - Association Rules

Demonstrate your knowledge __Association Rules__ and the five machine learning steps using this algorithm.

For this homework use the __Online Retail__ dataset provided by UCIâ€™s ML Repository (<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail>).
Please read over the data source to find more details about the data.
Run a market basket analysis on this data and figure out the __Association Rules__.
Does the data need to be transformed for this algorithm, or is the current form ok?

## Requirements

* Use __Association Rules__ algorithm.
* Use __Online Retail__ dataset accessed from UCI's website.
* Describe the accuracy of the model.
* When improving performance, use the algorithms specific options for improving the model.
    Remember you must show at least __two__ options considered when improving the performance.
* Use the following R commands/features: __itemFrequency__, __itemFrequencyPlot__, and __image__.
* Save the association rules to a file.
    Follow the books example.
* Include any additional R commands that help describe or detail the data and analysis.
