# Homework 2 - Naive Bayes

Demonstrate your knowledge __Naive Bayes__ and the five machine learning steps using this algorithm.

For this homework use the _adult_ dataset provided by UCI's ML Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).
The dataset has many features about a person and your goal is to show if they make more or less than 50K.
The dataset will need to be prepared with order and unordered factors.
Using __Naive Bayes__, how accurately can you classify an their income?
The dataset includes missing information, does this pose a problem for your algorithm?

## Requirements

* Use __Naive Bayes__ algorithm.
* Use __adult__ dataset accessed from UCI's website.
* Apply categorization to a continuous variable.
* In the initial evaluation, use the following fields: _workclass_, _education_, _relationship_, _native-country_.
* In the improvement step, add or remove fields to improve your prediction. Explain your argument for adding or removing.
* Use the following R commands/features: __str__, and a __CrossTable__.
* Include any additional R commands that help describe or detail the data and analysis.

## Rubric

Sections of the report (5 points for each section):

* Algorithm Description
* Step 1 - Collect Data
* Step 2 - Exploring And Preparing The Data
* Step 3 - Training A Model On The Data
* Step 4 - Evaluating Model Performance
* Step 5 - Improving Model Performance

Additional points may be deducted if not all requirements are meet.

__Total:__ 30 points
