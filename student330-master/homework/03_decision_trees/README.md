# Homework 3 - Decision Trees

Demonstrate your knowledge __Decision Trees__ and the five machine learning steps using this algorithm.

For this homework use the __Mushrooms__ dataset provided by UCIâ€™s ML Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom). Please read over the data source to find more details
about the data. Using __Decision Trees__, how accurately can you classify an editable mushroom? Are the
decisions easy enough for a person to remember?

## Requirements

* Use __C5.0 decision trees__ algorithm.
* Use __Mushrooms__ dataset accessed from UCI's website.
* In the initial evaluation, use one of the following random seed values: 201, 323, 509, 678, 909.
* In the improvement step, use the random seeds of 770.
* Consider two different methods of improving your model. Each method may require using various
  parameter to tune.
  * Adaptive boosting.
  * Cost matrix.
  * Try an different decision tree algorithm.
* If you have a great model, you need to justify why it is a great model. This may mean changing your
  original model and show your great model in the improvement section of the report.
* Use the following R commands/features: __train__, and a __sample__
* Include any additional R commands that help describe or detail the data and analysis.

## Rubric

Sections of the report (5 points for each section):

* Algorithm Description
* Step 1 - Collect Data
* Step 2 - Exploring And Preparing The Data
* Step 3 - Training A Model On The Data
* Step 4 - Evaluating Model Performance
* Step 5 - Improving Model Performance

Additional points may be deducted if not all requirements are meet.

__Total:__ 30 points
