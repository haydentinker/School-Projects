# CPTR 142 Project III: ASCII Snek

Our proposed project is a personal take on the traditional arcade game, Snake.

## Problem Definition

Our goal with this project is to recreate the single-player game Snake using ASCII characters.
There will be a defined "playing field" and the traditional elements of the game, including "death"
upon running into yourself and an increasing snake size as the game progresses.

### Key Features

* Randomly occuring "fruit" to increase the size of el snek
* Option: Dynamic board size/difficulty level
