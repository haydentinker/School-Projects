# MATH 215 Student Repository
## Exam Directory

This directory will contain two files, one for each exam in the
course (midterm and final).  These take-home exams will be made 
available as R Notebook files when the exam period begins and you 
must have your work finished and pushed back to the repository by
the end of the exam window.
